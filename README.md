# üß≠ Retail Sales Analysis ‚Äì Power BI Project

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics and dashboarding process** using **Power BI, Excel, SQL, and Python** ‚Äî focused on retail sales performance, profitability, and regional trends.

The dataset covers **3,000+ sales transactions across 2023‚Äì2024**, spanning multiple products, customers, cities, and channels.  
The dashboard delivers business insights around revenue, orders, profit, customer segmentation, and regional performance ‚Äî designed for **data-driven decision-making**.

---

##  Business Objective
To analyze key sales and profit metrics that can:
- Track revenue growth and profitability trends over time  
- Identify top-performing product categories and regions  
- Evaluate customer segments and sales channels  
- Enable leadership teams to make faster, data-backed strategic decisions  

---

##  Data Model & Architecture
The project follows a **Star Schema** for clean and efficient analytics:

| Table | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **FactSales** | Contains transactional details like OrderDate, Quantity, UnitPrice, Discount, ShippingCost |
| **DimProduct** | Includes ProductName, Category, Subcategory, Brand, and UnitCost |
| **DimCustomer** | Contains CustomerID, CustomerName, and Segment |
| **DimGeo** | Defines Country, Region, State, City, and coordinates for map visuals |
| **DimDate** | Holds temporal hierarchy like Year, Month, Quarter, and Week |

>  *All data is clean, with no missing values and consistent keys.*

---

##  Key Measures (DAX)
A few of the key calculated measures used:

```DAX
Total Revenue =
SUMX (
    FactSales,
    FactSales[Quantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice] * (1 - FactSales[Discount])
)

Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(FactSales[OrderID])

AOV = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Orders])

Total Profit =
VAR COGS = SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[Quantity] * RELATED(DimProduct[UnitCost]))
VAR Shipping = SUM(FactSales[ShippingCost])
RETURN [Total Revenue] - COGS - Shipping
````

Additional measures include:

* **Revenue LY** (YoY comparison)
* **YoY % Growth** using SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR

##  Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard contains **9 visuals** arranged for clarity and decision support:

| Visual                     | Description                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **KPI Cards**              | Total Revenue, Profit, Orders, Customers, Quantity |
| **Line Chart**             | Revenue trend by Month                             |
| **Clustered Column Chart** | Revenue by Category                                |
| **Stacked Bar Chart**      | Revenue by Region and Channel                      |
| **Map Visual**             | City-level bubbles sized by Revenue                |
| **Matrix Table**           | Category vs Region (Revenue & Profit)              |
| **Donut Chart**            | Segment-wise Revenue Contribution                  |

Each visual is fully interactive with slicers for **Year, Category, and Channel** filters.
